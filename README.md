# CS428-Project1-KnickKnacks
Project 1 is focused on Augmented Reality. In the future when everyone is wearing their AR enabled eye-wear much of the time, what kind of future will it be? We are going to explore this a bit by looking into some AR knickknacks. A common thing to see in shops when you travel are small snow globes or other little trinkets that you can take home and place on a desk or a shelf to remind you of the place - i.e. the things you could buy in the shops on Navy Pier that highlight aspects of the city. What if these were virtual instead of real so you could have the same physical placeholder that could take on the form of different knickknacks. Since these are virtual they could also be somewhat 'smarter' than their older siblings. In our case we are going to have these knickknacks be able to grab the current weather at the location they represent, and have them also function as a magic 8-ball when you turn them upside down.
